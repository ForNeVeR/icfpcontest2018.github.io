* This is an open contest.  Anyone may participate except for the ICFP
  Programming Contest 2018 organizers ("Organizers") and members of their
  research groups.

* No advance registration or entry fee is required.

* Contestants are free to organize themselves into teams of any size.  A
  contestant may only be a member of a single team.  Teams may not divide,
  merge, or collaborate after the start of the contest.

* Teams are free to use any programming language(s) on any platform(s).

* Teams must register during the contest to obtain a team-specific private
  identifier that will be used for submissions and profiles.  Teams using more
  than one private identifier during the contest may be disqualified.

* Teams will not be required to submit executables.  Teams wishing to be
  considered for prizes must submit source code at the end of the contest.  The
  exact details of contest submissions will be announced at the start of the
  contest.  Teams may submit multiple times during the contest; early
  submissions may be evaluated during the contest for live standings, but only
  the last submissions for the lightning division and the full contest will be
  considered for prizes.

* The Organizers retain the right to monitor, record, and investigate the
  submissions, other contest-related activities, or lack thereof, of contestants
  and teams. The records are used for the sole purpose of judgment and are
  discarded once the contest-related events are over. Violations of these rules
  and regulations, attempts to compromise the integrity of the contest
  infrastructure, attempts to interfere with other contestants, or attempts to
  contravene the spirit of the contest will lead to disqualification of the
  involved contestants and/or teams.

* Contestants retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to any
  submitted solutions, source code, custom tools, and related materials
  ("Submissions") that contestants had before submission.  As a condition of
  submission, contestants grant the Organizers a non-exclusive, perpetual,
  irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, publish,
  distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the Submissions for the
  purposes of allowing the Organizers to test and evaluate the Submissions for
  purposes of the contest.

* All decisions of the Organizers are final.
